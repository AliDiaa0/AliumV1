# AliumV1
A stupid computer virus written by Ali Diaa in C# and Assembly language, it looks ugly and stupid, it's my first computer virus!

This virus is written by me. Please don't just copy and paste the source code as your own work. Copying/stealing people's work isn't a nice thing. Please respect my code.

This is the first version of the virus, which means there will be other versions of the same virus with different payloads or some improvements in the future.

Note: You must install .NET Framework version 4 before executing this virus, otherwise the virus won't run!
