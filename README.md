# AliumV1
A simple computer virus written by Ali Diaa in C# and Assembly language. This virus displays many GDI graphics on your screen and harms your personal files, so don't try it on your main device!

This virus is written by me. Please don't just copy and paste the source code as your own work. Copying/stealing people's work isn't a nice thing. Please respect my code.

This is the first version of the virus, which means there will be other versions of the same virus with different payloads or some improvements in the future.
