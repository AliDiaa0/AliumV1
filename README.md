# AliumV1
A simple computer virus, written in C# and Assembly language by Ali Diaa. This virus shows many GDI drawings on the screen and it harms your personal files, so don't try it on your main machine!

This virus is written by me. Please don't just copy-paste the source code as it's your own work. Copying / stealing people's work isn't nice. Please respect my code.
